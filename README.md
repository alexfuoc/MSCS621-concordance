# Swagger generated Concordance server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask. **May have to import this library separately with this command
```
pip install connexion[swagger-ui] --user
```

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage with Cloud9 EC2 server
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory. Make sure to specify --user if you do not have access:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://18.217.73.244:8080/mscs721/concordance/1.0.0/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://18.217.73.244:8080/mscs721/concordance/1.0.0/swagger.json
```
