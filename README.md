# Swagger generated Concordance server

## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask. \*\*May have to import this library separately with this command

```
pip install connexion[swagger-ui] --user
```

## Requirements

Python 3.5.2+

## Usage with Cloud9 EC2 server

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory. Make sure to specify --user if you do not have access:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://18.217.73.244:8080/mscs721/concordance/1.0.0/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://18.217.73.244:8080/mscs721/concordance/1.0.0/swagger.json
```

## Running with uWSGI locally

To run for production mode, use uWSGI:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
uwsgi --http :8080 --wsgi-file swagger_server/__main__.py --callable application

OR (using uwsgi.ini config file)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
uwsgi uwsgi.ini
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t mscs621-concordance .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2 mscs621-concordance
```

## Adding Fontend with Docker Compose

Contains a docker-compose file, orechstrating a ReactJS frontend container and Python uWSGI backend container. It is served off of http://localhost. Note\*\* missing .env files in both frontend and backup folders

To build and run both of the Docker containers, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# create the images and run both containers (--build force builds a new image)
docker-compose up --build
```
