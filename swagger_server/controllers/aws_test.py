For this part of the\nIndian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen\ncall a lively ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of\nporpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of\nmore stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the\nin-shore ground off Peru.\n\nIt was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders\nleaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed\nin what seemed an enchanted air.  No resolution could withstand it;\nin that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went\nout of my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum\nwill, long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.\n\nEre forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the\nseamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy.  So\nthat at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for\nevery swing that we made there was a nod from below from the\nslumbering helmsman.  The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests;\nand across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the\nsun over all.\n\nSuddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices\nmy hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency\npreserved me; with a shock I came back to life.  And lo! close under\nour lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in\nthe water like the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy\nback, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun's rays like a\nmirror.  But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and\nanon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet, the whale looked like a\nportly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon.  But that pipe,\npoor whale, was thy last.  As if struck by some enchanter's wand, the\nsleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into\nwakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the\nvessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth\nthe accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted\nthe sparkling brine into the air.\n\n\"Clear away the boats!  Luff!\" cried Ahab.  And obeying his own\norder, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the\nspokes.\n\nThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and\nere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the\nleeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few\nripples as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be\nalarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man\nmust speak but in whispers.  So seated like Ontario Indians on the\ngunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the\ncalm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set.  Presently, as\nwe thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail\nforty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower\nswallowed up.\n\n\"There go flukes!\" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed\nby Stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a\nrespite was granted.  After the full interval of his sounding had\nelapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the\nsmoker's boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb\ncounted upon the honour of the capture.  It was obvious, now, that the\nwhale had at length become aware of his pursuers.  All silence of\ncautiousness was therefore no longer of use.  Paddles were dropped,\nand oars came loudly into play.  And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb\ncheered on his crew to the assault.\n\nYes, a mighty change had come over the fish.  All alive to his\njeopardy, he was going \"head out\"; that part obliquely projecting\nfrom the mad yeast which he brewed.*\n\n\n*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance\nthe entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists.\nThough apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant\npart about him.  So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and\ninvariably does so when going at his utmost speed.  Besides, such is\nthe breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the\ntapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely\nelevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from\na bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York\npilot-boat.\n\n\n\"Start her, start her, my men!  Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty\nof time--but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that's all,\"\ncried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke.  \"Start her, now;\ngive 'em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego.  Start her, Tash, my\nboy--start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool--cucumbers is the\nword--easy, easy--only start her like grim death and grinning devils,\nand raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves,\nboys--that's all.  Start her!\"\n\n\"Woo-hoo!  Wa-hee!\" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some\nold war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat\ninvoluntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke\nwhich the eager Indian gave.\n\nBut his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild.\n\"Kee-hee!  Kee-hee!\" yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards\non his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.\n\n\"Ka-la!  Koo-loo!\" howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a\nmouthful of Grenadier's steak.  And thus with oars and yells the\nkeels cut the sea.  Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the\nvan, still encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the\nsmoke from his mouth.  Like desperadoes they tugged and they\nstrained, till the welcome cry was heard--\"Stand up, Tashtego!--give\nit to him!\"  The harpoon was hurled.  \"Stern all!\"  The oarsmen\nbacked water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along\nevery one of their wrists.  It was the magical line.  An instant\nbefore, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round\nthe loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a\nhempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes\nfrom his pipe.  As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so\nalso, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through\nand through both of Stubb's hands, from which the hand-cloths, or\nsquares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times, had\naccidentally dropped.  It was like holding an enemy's sharp two-edged\nsword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it\nout of your clutch.\n\n\"Wet the line! wet the line!\" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him\nseated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into\nit.*  More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.\nThe boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.\nStubb and Tashtego here changed places--stem for stern--a staggering\nbusiness truly in that rocking commotion.\n\n\n*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be\nstated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the\nrunning line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or\nbailer, is set apart for that purpose.  Your hat, however, is the\nmost convenient.\n\n\nFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part\nof the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you\nwould have thought the craft had two keels--one cleaving the water,\nthe other the air--as the boat churned on through both opposing\nelements at once.  A continual cascade played at the bows; a\nceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion\nfrom within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking\ncraft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea.  Thus they\nrushed; each man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent\nbeing tossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the\nsteering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring down his\ncentre of gravity.  Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as\nthey shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened\nhis flight.\n\n\"Haul in--haul in!\" cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round\ntowards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while\nyet the boat was being towed on.  Soon ranging up by his flank,\nStubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart\nafter dart into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat\nalternately sterning out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow,\nand then ranging up for another fling.\n\nThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks\ndown a hill.  His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood,\nwhich bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake.  The\nslanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back\nits reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to each other\nlike red men.  And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was\nagonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff\nafter puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart,\nhauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb\nstraightened it again and again, by a few rapid blows against the\ngunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.\n\n\"Pull up--pull up!\" he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale\nrelaxed in his wrath.  \"Pull up!--close to!\" and the boat ranged\nalong the fish's flank.  When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly\nchurned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there,\ncarefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel\nafter some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which\nhe was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out.  But that gold\nwatch he sought was the innermost life of the fish.  And now it is\nstruck; for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing\ncalled his \"flurry,\" the monster horribly wallowed in his blood,\noverwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the\nimperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to\nstruggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the\nday.\n\nAnd now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into\nview; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and\ncontracting his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized\nrespirations.  At last, gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it\nhad been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and\nfalling back again, ran dripping down his motionless flanks into\nthe sea.  His heart had burst!\n\n\"He's dead, Mr. Stubb,\" said Daggoo.\n\n\"Yes; both pipes smoked out!\" and withdrawing his own from his mouth,\nStubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment,\nstood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 62\n\nThe Dart.\n\n\nA word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\n\nAccording to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat\npushes off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as\ntemporary steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the\nforemost oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar.  Now it needs a\nstrong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for\noften, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be\nflung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet.  But however\nprolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to\npull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to\nset an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by\nincredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;\nand what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's compass, while\nall the other muscles are strained and half started--what that is\nnone know but those who have tried it.  For one, I cannot bawl very\nheartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time.  In this\nstraining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at\nonce the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry--\"Stand up, and\ngive it to him!\"  He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round\non his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with\nwhat little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into\nthe whale.  No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body,\nthat out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful;\nno wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and\ndisrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their\nblood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are\nabsent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship\nowners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer\nthat makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how\ncan you expect to find it there when most wanted!\n\nAgain, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical\ninstant, that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and\nharpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent\njeopardy of themselves and every one else.  It is then they change\nplaces; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft,\ntakes his proper station in the bows of the boat.\n\nNow, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both\nfoolish and unnecessary.  The headsman should stay in the bows from\nfirst to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no\nrowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances\nobvious to any fisherman.  I know that this would sometimes involve a\nslight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various\nwhalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast\nmajority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so\nmuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the\nharpooneer that has caused them.\n\nTo insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of\nthis world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not\nfrom out of toil.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 63\n\nThe Crotch.\n\n\nOut of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs.  So, in\nproductive subjects, grow the chapters.\n\nThe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent\nmention.  It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in\nlength, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale\nnear the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden\nextremity of the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly\nprojects from the prow.  Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to\nits hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a\nbackwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.  It is customary to have\ntwo harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first\nand second irons.\n\nBut these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with\nthe line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one\ninstantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the\ncoming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold.\nIt is a doubling of the chances.  But it very often happens that\nowing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale\nupon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the\nharpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the\nsecond iron into him.  Nevertheless, as the second iron is already\nconnected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon\nmust, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,\nsomehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve\nall hands.  Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases;\nthe spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making\nthis feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.  But this\ncritical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal\ncasualties.\n\nFurthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown\noverboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,\nskittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the\nlines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all\ndirections.  Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until\nthe whale is fairly captured and a corpse.\n\nConsider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging\none unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these\nqualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of\nsuch an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be\nsimultaneously dangling about him.  For, of course, each boat is\nsupplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the\nfirst one be ineffectually darted without recovery.  All these\nparticulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to\nelucidate several most important, however intricate passages, in\nscenes hereafter to be painted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 64\n\nStubb's Supper.\n\n\nStubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship.  It was a\ncalm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow\nbusiness of towing the trophy to the Pequod.  And now, as we eighteen\nmen with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\nfingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish\ncorpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at\nlong intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the\nenormousness of the mass we moved.  For, upon the great canal of\nHang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on\nthe foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile\nan hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if\nladen with pig-lead in bulk.\n\nDarkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's\nmain-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\ndropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks.  Vacantly\neyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for\nsecuring it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,\nwent his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until\nmorning.\n\nThough, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\nevinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the\ncreature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or\ndespair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body\nreminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a\nthousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not\none jot advance his grand, monomaniac object.  Very soon you would\nhave thought from the sound on the Pequod's decks, that all hands\nwere preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being\ndragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.\nBut by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is\nto be moored.  Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the\nbows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel's\nand seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars\nand rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale, seemed yoked together\nlike colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains\nstanding.*\n\n\n*A little item may as well be related here.  The strongest and most\nreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored\nalongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density\nthat part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the\nside-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low\nbeneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from\nthe boat, in order to put the chain round it.  But this difficulty is\ningeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden\nfloat at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other\nend is secured to the ship.  By adroit management the wooden float is\nmade to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having\ngirdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and\nbeing slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the\nsmallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad\nflukes or lobes.\n\n\nIf moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be\nknown on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest,\nbetrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement.  Such an\nunwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck, his official\nsuperior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of\naffairs.  One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb,\nwas soon made strangely manifest.  Stubb was a high liver; he was\nsomewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his\npalate.\n\n\"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep!  You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and\ncut me one from his small!\"\n\nHere be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a\ngeneral thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the\nenemy defray the current expenses of the war (at least before\nrealizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet now and then you find some\nof these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular\npart of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering\nextremity of the body.\n\nAbout midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two\nlanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti\nsupper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard.  Nor\nwas Stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night.  Mingling\ntheir mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of\nsharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its\nfatness.  The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled\nby the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few\ninches of the sleepers' hearts.  Peering over the side you could just\nsee them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black\nwaters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge\nglobular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head.  This\nparticular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous.  How at such\nan apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such\nsymmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all\nthings.  The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened\nto the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.\n\nThough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight,\nsharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks, like\nhungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to\nbolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while\nthe valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving\neach other's live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled,\nthe sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely\ncarving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you\nto turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much\nthe same thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough\nfor all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders\nof all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting\nalongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or\na dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like\ninstances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and\noccasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most\nhilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when\nyou will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more\njovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a\nwhaleship at sea.  If you have never seen that sight, then suspend\nyour decision about the propriety of devil-worship, and the\nexpediency of conciliating the devil.\n\nBut, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was\ngoing on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of\nhis own epicurean lips.\n\n\"Cook, cook!--where's that old Fleece?\" he cried at length, widening\nhis legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his\nsupper; and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if\nstabbing with his lance; \"cook, you cook!--sail this way, cook!\"\n\nThe old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously\nroused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came\nshambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was\nsomething the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well\nscoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him,\ncame shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs,\nwhich, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops;\nthis old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of\ncommand, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb's\nsideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and resting on\nhis two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further over, at\nthe same time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his best\near into play.\n\n\"Cook,\" said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his\nmouth, \"don't you think this steak is rather overdone?  You've been\nbeating this steak too much, cook; it's too tender.  Don't I always\nsay that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough?  There are those\nsharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and\nrare?  What a shindy they are kicking up!  Cook, go and talk to 'em;\ntell 'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly, and in\nmoderation, but they must keep quiet.  Blast me, if I can hear my own\nvoice.  Away, cook, and deliver my message.  Here, take this\nlantern,\" snatching one from his sideboard; \"now then, go and preach\nto 'em!\"\n\nSullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the\ndeck to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low\nover the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the\nother hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the\nside in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb,\nsoftly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.\n\n\"Fellow-critters: I'se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam\nnoise dare.  You hear?  Stop dat dam smackin' ob de lips!  Massa\nStubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but\nby Gor! you must stop dat dam racket!\"\n\n\"Cook,\" here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden\nslap on the shoulder,--\"Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn't swear\nthat way when you're preaching.  That's no way to convert sinners,\ncook!\"\n\n\"Who dat?  Den preach to him yourself,\" sullenly turning to go.\n\n\"No, cook; go on, go on.\"\n\n\"Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:\"-\n\n\"Right!\" exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, \"coax 'em to it; try that,\"\nand Fleece continued.\n\n\"Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,\nfellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness--'top dat dam slappin' ob de\ntail!  How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin'\nand bitin' dare?\"\n\n\"Cook,\" cried Stubb, collaring him, \"I won't have that swearing.\nTalk to 'em gentlemanly.\"\n\nOnce more the sermon proceeded.\n\n\"Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don't blame ye so much for;\ndat is natur, and can't be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur,\ndat is de pint.  You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in\nyou, why den you be angel; for all angel is not'ing more dan de shark\nwell goberned.  Now, look here, bred'ren, just try wonst to be cibil,\na helping yourselbs from dat whale.  Don't be tearin' de blubber out\nyour neighbour's mout, I say.  Is not one shark dood right as toder\nto dat whale?  And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale;\ndat whale belong to some one else.  I know some o' you has berry brig\nmout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de\nsmall bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid,\nbut to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can't get\ninto de scrouge to help demselves.\"\n\n\"Well done, old Fleece!\" cried Stubb, \"that's Christianity; go on.\"\n\n\"No use goin' on; de dam willains will keep a scougin' and slappin'\neach oder, Massa Stubb; dey don't hear one word; no use a-preaching\nto such dam g'uttons as you call 'em, till dare bellies is full, and\ndare bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get 'em full, dey wont\nhear you den; for den dey sink in the sea, go fast to sleep on de\ncoral, and can't hear noting at all, no more, for eber and eber.\"\n\n\"Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the\nbenediction, Fleece, and I'll away to my supper.\"\n\nUpon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his\nshrill voice, and cried--\n\n\"Cussed fellow-critters!  Kick up de damndest row as ever you can;\nfill your dam bellies 'till dey bust--and den die.\"\n\n\"Now, cook,\" said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; \"stand\njust where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay\nparticular attention.\"\n\n\"All 'dention,\" said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in\nthe desired position.\n\n\"Well,\" said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; \"I shall now go\nback to the subject of this steak.  In the first place, how old are\nyou, cook?\"\n\n\"What dat do wid de 'teak,\" said the old black, testily.\n\n\"Silence!  How old are you, cook?\"\n\n\"'Bout ninety, dey say,\" he gloomily muttered.\n\n\"And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,\nand don't know yet how to cook a whale-steak?\" rapidly bolting\nanother mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a\ncontinuation of the question.  \"Where were you born, cook?\"\n\n\"'Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin' ober de Roanoke.\"\n\n\"Born in a ferry-boat!  That's queer, too.  But I want to know what\ncountry you were born in, cook!\"\n\n\"Didn't I say de Roanoke country?\" he cried sharply.\n\n\"No, you didn't, cook; but I'll tell you what I'm coming to, cook.\nYou must go home and be born over again; you don't know how to cook a\nwhale-steak yet.\"\n\n\"Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,\" he growled, angrily, turning\nround to depart.\n\n\"Come back here, cook;--here, hand me those tongs;--now take that bit\nof steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it\nshould be?  Take it, I say\"--holding the tongs towards him--\"take it,\nand taste it.\"\n\nFaintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old\nnegro muttered, \"Best cooked 'teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.\"\n\n\"Cook,\" said Stubb, squaring himself once more; \"do you belong to the\nchurch?\"\n\n\"Passed one once in Cape-Down,\" said the old man sullenly.\n\n\"And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,\nwhere you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as\nhis beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook!  And yet you come here,\nand tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?\" said Stubb.\n\"Where do you expect to go to, cook?\"\n\n\"Go to bed berry soon,\" he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.\n\n\"Avast! heave to!  I mean when you die, cook.  It's an awful\nquestion.  Now what's your answer?\"\n\n\"When dis old brack man dies,\" said the negro slowly, changing his\nwhole air and demeanor, \"he hisself won't go nowhere; but some\nbressed angel will come and fetch him.\"\n\n\"Fetch him?  How?  In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah?  And\nfetch him where?\"\n\n\"Up dere,\" said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and\nkeeping it there very solemnly.\n\n\"So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when\nyou are dead?  But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it\ngets?  Main-top, eh?\"\n\n\"Didn't say dat t'all,\" said Fleece, again in the sulks.\n\n\"You said up there, didn't you? and now look yourself, and see where\nyour tongs are pointing.  But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven\nby crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you\ndon't get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging.\nIt's a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it's no go.  But\nnone of us are in heaven yet.  Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my\norders.  Do ye hear?  Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t'other\na'top of your heart, when I'm giving my orders, cook.  What! that\nyour heart, there?--that's your gizzard!  Aloft! aloft!--that's\nit--now you have it.  Hold it there now, and pay attention.\"\n\n\"All 'dention,\" said the old black, with both hands placed as\ndesired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears\nin front at one and the same time.\n\n\"Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,\nthat I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,\ndon't you?  Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak\nfor my private table here, the capstan, I'll tell you what to do so\nas not to spoil it by overdoing.  Hold the steak in one hand, and\nshow a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d'ye hear?\nAnd now to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure\nyou stand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle.\nAs for the ends of the flukes, have them soused, cook.  There, now ye\nmay go.\"\n\nBut Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.\n\n\"Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.\nD'ye hear? away you sail, then.--Halloa! stop! make a bow before you\ngo.--Avast heaving again!  Whale-balls for breakfast--don't forget.\"\n\n\"Wish, by gor! whale eat him, 'stead of him eat whale.  I'm bressed\nif he ain't more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,\" muttered the old\nman, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his\nhammock.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 65\n\nThe Whale as a Dish.\n\n\nThat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp,\nand, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems\nso outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the\nhistory and philosophy of it.\n\nIt is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\nWhale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\nprices there.  Also, that in Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook of\nthe court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce\nto be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a\nspecies of whale.  Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine\neating.  The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard\nballs, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for\nturtle-balls or veal balls.  The old monks of Dunfermline were very\nfond of them.  They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.\n\nThe fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\nhands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\nwhen you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\nlong, it takes away your appetite.  Only the most unprejudiced of men\nlike Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are\nnot so fastidious.  We all know how they live upon whales, and have\nrare old vintages of prime old train oil.  Zogranda, one of their\nmost famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as\nbeing exceedingly juicy and nourishing.  And this reminds me that\ncertain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland\nby a whaling vessel--that these men actually lived for several months\non the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after\ntrying out the blubber.  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are\ncalled \"fritters\"; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown\nand crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives'\ndough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.  They have such an eatable look\nthat the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.\n\nBut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\nexceeding richness.  He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to\nbe delicately good.  Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating\nas the buffalo's (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a\nsolid pyramid of fat.  But the spermaceti itself, how bland and\ncreamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a\ncocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply\na substitute for butter.  Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method\nof absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it.\nIn the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the\nseamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them\nfry there awhile.  Many a good supper have I thus made.\n\nIn the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine\ndish.  The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the\ntwo plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two\nlarge puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a\nmost delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head,\nwhich is quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that\nsome young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon\ncalves' brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own,\nso as to be able to tell a calf's head from their own heads; which,\nindeed, requires uncommon discrimination.  And that is the reason why\na young buck with an intelligent looking calf's head before him, is\nsomehow one of the saddest sights you can see.  The head looks a sort\nof reproachfully at him, with an \"Et tu Brute!\" expression.\n\nIt is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively\nunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with\nabhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the\nconsideration before mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly\nmurdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light.  But no\ndoubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a\nmurderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by\noxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved it if\nany murderer does.  Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see\nthe crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead\nquadrupeds.  Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal's\njaw?  Cannibals? who is not a cannibal?  I tell you it will be more\ntolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his\ncellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that\nprovident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee,\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground\nand feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras.\n\nBut Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is\nadding insult to injury, is it?  Look at your knife-handle, there, my\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what\nis that handle made of?--what but the bones of the brother of the\nvery ox you are eating?  And what do you pick your teeth with, after\ndevouring that fat goose?  With a feather of the same fowl.  And with\nwhat quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of\nCruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars?  It is only within\nthe last month or two that that society passed a resolution to\npatronise nothing but steel pens.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 66\n\nThe Shark Massacre.\n\n\nWhen in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and\nweary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a\ngeneral thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business\nof cutting him in.  For that business is an exceedingly laborious\none; is not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about\nit.  Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the\nhelm a'lee; and then send every one below to his hammock till\ndaylight, with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches\nshall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the\ncrew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.\n\nBut sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan\nwill not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks\ngather round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours,\nsay, on a stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by\nmorning.  In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish\ndo not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times\nconsiderably diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp\nwhaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some\ninstances, only seems to tickle them into still greater activity.\nBut it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod's sharks;\nthough, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have\nlooked over her side that night, would have almost thought the whole\nround sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.\n\nNevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper\nwas concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle\nseaman came on deck, no small excitement was created among the\nsharks; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side,\nand lowering three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light\nover the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting their long\nwhaling-spades, kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks,* by\nstriking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only\nvital part.  But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling\nhosts, the marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought\nabout new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe.  They\nviciously snapped, not only at each other's disembowelments, but like\nflexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails\nseemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be\noppositely voided by the gaping wound.  Nor was this all.  It was\nunsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures.  A\nsort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very\njoints and bones, after what might be called the individual life had\ndeparted.  Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin, one\nof these sharks almost took poor Queequeg's hand off, when he tried\nto shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.\n\n\n*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best\nsteel; is about the bigness of a man's spread hand; and in general\nshape, corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named;\nonly its sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably\nnarrower than the lower.  This weapon is always kept as sharp as\npossible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a\nrazor.  In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long,\nis inserted for a handle.\n\n\n\"Queequeg no care what god made him shark,\" said the savage,\nagonizingly lifting his hand up and down; \"wedder Fejee god or\nNantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 67\n\nCutting In.\n\n\nIt was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed!  Ex officio\nprofessors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen.  The ivory Pequod\nwas turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher.  You\nwould have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the\nsea gods.\n\nIn the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other\nponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted\ngreen, and which no single man can possibly lift--this vast bunch of\ngrapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower\nmast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship's deck.  The end\nof the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then\nconducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles\nwas swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook,\nweighing some one hundred pounds, was attached.  And now suspended in\nstages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their\nlong spades, began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of\nthe hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.  This done, a\nbroad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted,\nand the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence\nheaving in one dense crowd at the windlass.  When instantly, the\nentire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like\nthe nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles,\nquivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky.  More and more\nshe leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the\nwindlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at\nlast, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship\nrolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle\nrises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of\nthe first strip of blubber.  Now as the blubber envelopes the whale\nprecisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the\nbody precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it.\nFor the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps\nthe whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in\none strip uniformly peels off along the line called the \"scarf,\"\nsimultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates;\nand just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very\nact itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft\ntill its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then\ncease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping\nmass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one\npresent must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may\nbox his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.\n\nOne of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen\nweapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he\ndexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the\nswaying mass.  Into this hole, the end of the second alternating\ngreat tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber,\nin order to prepare for what follows.  Whereupon, this accomplished\nswordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a\nscientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate,\nlunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the\nshort lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a\nblanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering.  The\nheavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is\npeeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is\nslowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main\nhatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the\nblubber-room.  Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep\ncoiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass\nof plaited serpents.  And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles\nhoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass\nheaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the\nmates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing\noccasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 68\n\nThe Blanket.\n\n\nI have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin\nof the whale.  I have had controversies about it with experienced\nwhalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore.  My original opinion\nremains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.\n\nThe question is, what and where is the skin of the whale?  Already\nyou know what his blubber is.  That blubber is something of the\nconsistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic\nand compact, and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen\ninches in thickness.\n\nNow, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any\ncreature's skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness,\nyet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a\npresumption; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping\nlayer from the whale's body but that same blubber; and the outermost\nenveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be\nbut the skin?  True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you\nmay scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent\nsubstance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only\nit is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to\nbeing dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes\nrather hard and brittle.  I have several such dried bits, which I use\nfor marks in my whale-books.  It is transparent, as I said before;\nand being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself\nwith fancying it exerted a magnifying influence.  At any rate, it is\npleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you\nmay say.  But what I am driving at here is this.  That same\ninfinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the\nentire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin\nof the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were\nsimply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous\nwhale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child.\nBut no more of this.\n\nAssuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this\nskin, as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk\nof one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in\nquantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only\nthree fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea\nmay hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere\npart of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that.\nReckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net\nweight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale's skin.\n\nIn life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least\namong the many marvels he presents.  Almost invariably it is all over\nobliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in\nthick array, something like those in the finest Italian line\nengravings.  But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the\nisinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it,\nas if they were engraved upon the body itself.  Nor is this all.  In\nsome instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as\nin a veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other\ndelineations.  These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those\nmysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that\nis the proper word to use in the present connexion.  By my retentive\nmemory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was\nmuch struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters\nchiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the\nUpper Mississippi.  Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked\nwhale remains undecipherable.  This allusion to the Indian rocks\nreminds me of another thing.  Besides all the other phenomena which\nthe exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the\nback, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the\nregular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches,\naltogether of an irregular, random aspect.  I should say that those\nNew England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear\nthe marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs--I\nshould say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm\nWhale in this particular.  It also seems to me that such scratches in\nthe whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for\nI have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the\nspecies.\n\nA word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of\nthe whale.  It has already been said, that it is stript from him in\nlong pieces, called blanket-pieces.  Like most sea-terms, this one is\nvery happy and significant.  For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his\nblubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an\nIndian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity.  It is\nby reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is\nenabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas,\ntimes, and tides.  What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in\nthose shuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy\nsurtout?  True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those\nHyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded,\nlungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that\nwarm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter\nwould bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs\nand warm blood.  Freeze his blood, and he dies.  How wonderful is it\nthen--except after explanation--that this great monster, to whom\ncorporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful\nthat he should be found at home, immersed to his lips for life in\nthose Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are\nsometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the\nhearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber.  But more\nsurprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the\nblood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in\nsummer.\n\nIt does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong\nindividual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare\nvirtue of interior spaciousness.  Oh, man! admire and model thyself\nafter the whale!  Do thou, too, remain warm among ice.  Do thou, too,\nlive in this world without being of it.  Be cool at the equator; keep\nthy blood fluid at the Pole.  Like the great dome of St. Peter's, and\nlike the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of\nthine own.\n\nBut how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things!  Of\nerections, how few are domed like St. Peter's! of creatures, how few\nvast as the whale!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 69\n\nThe Funeral.\n\n\nHaul in the chains!  Let the carcase go astern!\n\nThe vast tackles have now done their duty.  The peeled white body of\nthe beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in\nhue, it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk.  It is still\ncolossal.  Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it\ntorn and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed\nwith rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so\nmany insulting poniards in the whale.  The vast white headless\nphantom floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that\nit so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of\nfowls, augment the murderous din.  For hours and hours from the\nalmost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen.  Beneath the\nunclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,\nwafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and\non, till lost in infinite perspectives.\n\nThere's a most doleful and most mocking funeral!  The sea-vultures\nall in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or\nspeckled.  In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I\nween, if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his\nfuneral they most piously do pounce.  Oh, horrible vultureism of\nearth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.\n\nNor is this the end.  Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost\nsurvives and hovers over it to scare.  Espied by some timid\nman-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the\ndistance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the\nwhite mass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high\nagainst it; straightway the whale's unharming corpse, with trembling\nfingers is set down in the log--SHOALS, ROCKS, AND BREAKERS\nHEREABOUTS: BEWARE!  And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun\nthe place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because\ntheir leader originally leaped there when a stick was held.  There's\nyour law of precedents; there's your utility of traditions; there's\nthe story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on\nthe earth, and now not even hovering in the air!  There's orthodoxy!\n\nThus, while in life the great whale's body may have been a real\nterror to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic\nto a world.\n\nAre you a believer in ghosts, my friend?  There are other ghosts than\nthe Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe\nin them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 70\n\nThe Sphynx.\n\n\nIt should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping\nthe body of the leviathan, he was beheaded.  Now, the beheading of\nthe Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which\nexperienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not\nwithout reason.\n\nConsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a\nneck; on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there,\nin that very place, is the thickest part of him.  Remember, also,\nthat the surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet\nintervening between him and his subject, and that subject almost\nhidden in a discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and\nbursting sea.  Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward\ncircumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that\nsubterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single peep into\nthe ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer clear\nof all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at a\ncritical point hard by its insertion into the skull.  Do you not\nmarvel, then, at Stubb's boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to\nbehead a sperm whale?\n\nWhen first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a\ncable till the body is stripped.  That done, if it belong to a small\nwhale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of.  But,\nwith a full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale's\nhead embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to\nsuspend such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a\nwhaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn\nin jewellers' scales.\n\nThe Pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head\nwas hoisted against the ship's side--about half way out of the sea,\nso that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native\nelement.  And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it,\nby reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and\nevery yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves;\nthere, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod's waist like the\ngiant Holofernes's from the girdle of Judith.\n\nWhen this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went\nbelow to their dinner.  Silence reigned over the before tumultuous\nbut now deserted deck.  An intense copper calm, like a universal\nyellow lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless\nleaves upon the sea.\n\nA short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone\nfrom his cabin.  Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to\ngaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took\nStubb's long spade--still remaining there after the whale's\nDecapitation--and striking it into the lower part of the\nhalf-suspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm,\nand so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.\n\nIt was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so\nintense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx's in the desert.  \"Speak, thou\nvast and venerable head,\" muttered Ahab, \"which, though ungarnished\nwith a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak,\nmighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee.  Of all\ndivers, thou hast dived the deepest.  That head upon which the upper\nsun now gleams, has moved amid this world's foundations.  Where\nunrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot;\nwhere in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with\nbones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful water-land,\nthere was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been where bell or diver\nnever went; hast slept by many a sailor's side, where sleepless\nmothers would give their lives to lay them down.  Thou saw'st the\nlocked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart\nthey sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven\nseemed false to them.  Thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed by\npirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper\nmidnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on\nunharmed--while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that\nwould have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.\nO head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an\ninfidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!\"\n\n\"Sail ho!\" cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.\n\n\"Aye?  Well, now, that's cheering,\" cried Ahab, suddenly erecting\nhimself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.  \"That\nlively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better\nman.--Where away?\"\n\n\"Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze\nto us!\n\n\"Better and better, man.  Would now St. Paul would come along that\nway, and to my breezelessness bring his breeze!  O Nature, and O soul\nof man! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not\nthe smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning\nduplicate in mind.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 71\n\nThe Jeroboam's Story.\n\n\nHand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster\nthan the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.\n\nBy and by, through the glass the stranger's boats and manned\nmast-heads proved her a whale-ship.  But as she was so far to\nwindward, and shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other\nground, the Pequod could not hope to reach her.  So the signal was\nset to see what response would be made.\n\nHere be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships\nof the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which\nsignals being collected in a book with the names of the respective\nvessels attached, every captain is provided with it.  Thereby, the\nwhale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean,\neven at considerable distances and with no small facility.\n\nThe Pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's\nsetting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of\nNantucket.  Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the\nPequod's lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the\nside-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck's order to accommodate the\nvisiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from his\nboat's stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary.\nIt turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board,\nand that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod's\ncompany.  For, though himself and boat's crew remained untainted, and\nthough his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea\nand air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to\nthe timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come\ninto direct contact with the Pequod.\n\nBut this did by no means prevent all communications.  Preserving an\ninterval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the\nJeroboam's boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep\nparallel to the Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by\nthis time it blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though,\nindeed, at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the\nboat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully\nbrought to her proper bearings again.  Subject to this, and other the\nlike interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained between\nthe two parties; but at intervals not without still another\ninterruption of a very different sort.\n"
